The purpose of this document is to describe in details the steps required to
assess the artifact associated to our paper.

We would like you to be able to

- reproduce our benchmarks from Figure 15, Section 6.1. For that purpose,
  complete Step 1 of this document.

- test the main use case (OAuth) from the paper, described in Figure 15, Section
  6.3. For that purpose, complete Step 2.1 of this document.

- compile the global protocols, reported in Figure 15, Section 6.2. For that
  purpose, complete Step 3 of this document.

Additionally, you can try some of the other protocols that we have implemented,
such as DNS (See Step 2.2). You can also verify examples and use cases (Step 4.1
and 4.2) and implement your own protocols (Step 4.3) using our library.

## Getting started

For the ECOOP'20 artifact evaluation, please use the VM prepared:

1. Download our VM as explained in the artifact pdf (artifact.pdf).
2. Load it in [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and boot it.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to ~/ocaml-mpst-lwt.
4. Follow the instructions below.

In the following, we assume that you are in the ocaml-mpst-lwt directory.

## Artifact layout

In addition to the source code of the library, which is a git clone of
[ocaml-mpst](https://github.com/keigoi/ocaml-mpst/), the artifact also contains

- a [benchmark](benchmark/) folder, which includes the source of the benchmarks
  and the scripts for producing the graphs (Section 6.1, Figure 15)
- an [examples](examples/) folder, which includes various examples, including
  [examples/mpst/toy_oauth.ml file](examples/mpst/toy_oauth.ml) with the running
  example from the paper (Section 2).
- an [examples/protocols](examples/protocols) folder, which includes the global
  combinators from Figure 16 (Section 6.2).
- a script, [examples/run_oauth.sh](examples/run_oauth.sh), for running the
  OAuth use case (Section 6.3)
- a tutorial that guides you through implementing and testing your own examples

## Step 0: Build all examples

```
dune build @examples/all
```

## STEP 1: Run mpst-ocaml benchmarks (Section 6.1)

- Run the benchmarks script (it should take approximately 10-15 min):

```
./benchmark/run_all.sh
```

You can supply optional quota parameter for running time of each test (2s).

```
./benchmark/run_all.sh 2s
```

- Display the graphs from the paper using jupyter-notebook

```
jupyter-notebook benchmark/graphs/Graphs.ipynb
```

The jupyter script will open in a new chrome tab. Click Run to run the script
and display the graphs. At the bottom of the page, you will see a summary of the
results. The graphs correspond to Figure 15 (Section 6.1)

More information about the source of the benchmarks is available
[here](benchmark/).

**Note**: Bear in mind that the benchmark data in the paper was generated using
machine with Intel Core i7-7700K CPU (4.20GHz, 4 cores), Ubuntu 17.10, Linux
4.13.0-46-generic, 16GB, while the script attached here are tailored to a
single-core VM. The benchmarks in the VM may show deviations if the VM does not
have sufficient resources(i.e 1. the host hardware is not enough, or 2. other
apps are running in the host). To minimise deviation, please run the VM in a
host with sufficient hardware specs (16 GB RAM, 4 CPU cores). Make sure that you
do not have any other applications running in your host machine, while
performing the benchmarks.

## STEP 2: Run applications, written with ocaml-mpst (Section 6.2 and 6.3)

### STEP 2.1: Run an OAuth use case (Section 6.3)

- Prepare an HTTPS server with a proper SSL certificate (e.g. Let's Encrypt)

- Register your Facebook app at https://developers.facebook.com/apps/ and modify
  parameters in [oauth.ml](examples/oauth/oauth.ml) appropriately.

- Then, run the `run_oauth` script:

```
./examples/run_oauth.sh
```

This will start an OAuth application process. Open your server's entry point
using a web browser. It will be forward you to Facebook login page; please use
your own facebook account to login.

- After your enter the test account credentials, you will see an _acccess
  accepted_ message.
- The source code of the example is in
  [oauth.ml in the examples/ folder](examples/oauth/oauth.ml).

### STEP 2.2: Run a dns server (Section 6.2)

- run the `run_dns` script

```
./examples/run_dns.sh
```

- you may be promted to enter a root password. If so, enter the password.
- open a new termninal tab and test the dns server is working. For example, you
  can try with:

```
host -t nagoya.my.domain 127.0.0.1
```

The server will answer 1.2.3.4.

or with:

```
host -t www.google.com 127.0.0.1
```

- the source code of the example is in
  [dnsserver.ml in the examples/ folder](examples/dns/dnsserver.ml).

### STEP 2.3: Run an SMTP client (Section 6.2)

You need to prepare an SMTP e-mail forwarding server.

- run the run_smtp script

```
./examples/run_smtp.sh hostname[:port]
```

Then it will ask sender and recipient address, and message body (single line).

## STEP 3: Compile the global protocol combinators (Section 6.2)

All global protocol combinators from the paper are in the examples/protocols
folder. To compile all global protocol combinators from Figure 16 run:

```
dune build @examples/protocols/all
```

- You can modify and test some of these protocols to ensure that an error is
  detected. To test if a global protocol compiles after you have modify it, run:

`dune build examples/protocols/the_name_of_the_protocol.exe`

where you have to replace the_name_of_the_protocol with the name of the file
that you are modifying.

Note that this folder contains only the protocols. The easiest way to explore
the channel vectors inferred by running the global combinators is to open
VSCode, choose some of the files from the protocol folder, and hover over the
type of the global combinator. If you plan to use VS code, before opening it,
first build all examples from the terminal in watch mode:

To enable the `--watch` command, install the `inotify-tools`:

`sudo apt install inotify-tools`

Then build the examples:

```
dune build --watch @example/all
```

## Step 4: Other examples and implementing your own protocols (Optional)

1. Check if protocols are correct

- open the [ring.ml](examples/mpst/ring.ml) file
- uncomment the various global combinators at the bottom of the file and check
  the error messages

2. Experiment with a simple calculator

- open the [examples/mpst/calc.ml](examples/mpst/calc.ml) file. Run the example:

```
dune exec ./examples/mpst/calc.exe
```

Note: Do not get confused by the .exe extension. This is not the Windows
executable. It is a dune convention. The file calc.exe does not exist in
/examples/mpst but lies inside the `_build` folder.

- check that errors are reported when you introduce an error in the
  implementation. For example:
  - modify the type of the payload in line
    [21](https://github.com/keigoi/ocaml-mpst/blob/master/examples/mpst/calc.ml#L21)
    (change 10 to "10")
  - modify line
    [22](https://github.com/keigoi/ocaml-mpst/blob/master/examples/mpst/calc.ml#L22)
    by replaceing `result` with `answer` (this will triger a protocol deviation
    error)

3. Create a simple ring protocol

- open VSCode (Before that make sure that you have build all the examples:
  ` dune build @examples/all`)
- follow the short tutorial
  [here](https://github.com/keigoi/ocaml-mpst/wiki/Ocaml-mpst-in-5-minutes) to
  implement the protocol

**Hint:** If you are struggling, the
[examples/mpst/ring.ml file](examples/mpst/ring.ml) contains the full
implementation, you can use it for reference.

#### Compile/run a new example

Use the following commands. The commands assumes the newly created file is
/examples/mpst/ring_protocol.ml.

- Open the dune file (/examples/mpst/dune) and add a new executable entry to it:

```
(executable
 (name ring_protocol)
 (modules ring_protocol)
 (libraries mpst))
```

- to build the example use:

```
dune build examples/mpst/ring_protocol.exe
```

- to execute the example use:

```
dune exec ./examples/mpst/ring_protocol.exe
```

#### **Note** on syntax discrepancies:

There are small syntax discrepancies between ocaml-mpst-lwt and the paper. The
running example of the paper uses the simplest in-built communication transport
in OCaml (Event).

The full ocaml-mpst library of the artifact is parametric on the underlying
transport. To enable this parametricity, we have created a wrapper that uses the
[lwt](https://ocsigen.org/lwt/5.2.0/manual/manual) transport when installed, and
switches to the in-built
[Event](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Event.html) module if
lwt is not available. To accommodate the lwt requirements, the wrapper requires
some syntactic changes as explained below.

Primitives `send`, `recv` and `close` are monadic in lwt, and you must first
declare monadic `let*` binding and use it, as follows:

```ocaml
open Concur_shims
let (let*) = IO.bind

let thread_A ch =
  let* ch = send ch#role_B#left "hello" in
  let* `msg(_,ch) = receive ch#role_C in ..
```

Pattern-matching `match` is not available for monads. Thus, when you make an
external choice, you must first bind the received variant to a variable, then
match on it, as follows:

```ocaml
let thread_B ch =
  let* var = receive ch#role_A in
  match var with
  | `left(x, ch) -> ...
  | `right(x, ch) -> ...
```

For details, see the
[notes on library dependencies](README.md#notes-on-optional-library-dependencies).

Note that, by un-installing `lwt`, ocaml-mpst uses only the in-build
[Event module](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Event.html) of
ocaml, matches the exact syntax from the paper.

## Additional details

- All examples are already compiled and the executables are
  `in_build/default/examples/**.exe.`
- The file [examples/mpst/toy_oauth.ml file](examples/mpst/toy_oauth.ml)
  contains the running example from the paper (Section 2). You can compile and
  run it with:

```
dune build examples/mpst/toy_oauth.exe
```

- If you wish to modify the existing example (e.g. examples/mpst/calc.ml) and
  recompile it, type

```
dune clean; dune @examples/mpst/all
```

If compilation fails, also try (if you are in the VM distribution):

```
opam switch ocaml-mpst-lwt; eval $(opam env)
```

## Additional information

- For instructions for compiling the ocaml-mpst on your own machine, see
  [README.md](https://github.com/keigoi/ocaml-mpst/blob/master/README.md). Note
  that some of the large examples (DNS, OAuth) need
  [additional dependencies](https://github.com/keigoi/ocaml-mpst/blob/master/README.md#libraries-used-in-examples-and-benchmarks).
  Running oAuth locally is more cumbursome since it requires to prepare a web
  server, register a facebook app, and insert your app's id into oauth.ml.
